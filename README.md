### README
Hi, here's my Zettelkasten (a personal knowledge management/note-taking system, essentially a second brain) made using obsidian and sync'ed through GitHub. It covers things I believe to be relevant to my life/work/research allowing me to store everything in a convenient and accessible manor. Feel free to pick my brain here and have a look at some of these topics.


### Notes to Self
This  just explains how to use the basic filing system through GitHub through Community Plugin Git (https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git) and my GitHub repository can be found at https://github.com/Me-Mac-Ward/Zettelkasten.

GitHub allows for this to be stored between different devices; process:
- On start-up run CTRL-P, Git: Pull - this retrieves updates from the GitHub repository Me-Mac-Ward/Zettelkasten.
- Periodically throughout and on finish upload this all to GitHub using CTRL-P, Git: Commit and Sync.
