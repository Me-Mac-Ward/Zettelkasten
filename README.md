This document just explains how to use the basic filing system through Github.

Github allows for this to be stored between different devices; process:
- On start-up run CTRL-P, Git: Pull - this retrieves updates from the github repository Me-Mac-Ward/Zettelkasten.
- Periodically throughout and on finish upload this all to github using CTRL-P, Git: Commit and Sync.
