### README
Hi, here's my Zettelkasten (a personal knowledge management/note-taking system, essentially a second brain) made using obsidian and sync'ed through GitHub. It covers things I believe to be relevant to my life/work/research allowing me to store everything in a convenient and accessible manor. Feel free to pick my brain here and have a look at some of these topics.


### How Does This Work?
This is comprised of small atomic notes which are linked together by \[\[tags\]\] or \[\[links\]\]. These group nodes together with arcs in the graph view. These \[\[tags\]\] can turn into MOCs (Maps of Content) for larger topics or when content must be reviewed together, such as for exams. MOCs allow for easy access to more niche topics, and include summaries of different sub-topics.


### Notes to Self
This  just explains how to use the basic filing system through GitHub through Community Plugin Git (https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git) and my GitHub repository can be found at https://github.com/Me-Mac-Ward/Zettelkasten.

GitHub allows for this to be stored between different devices; process:
- On start-up run CTRL-P, Git: Pull - this retrieves updates from the GitHub repository Me-Mac-Ward/Zettelkasten.
- Periodically throughout and on finish upload this all to GitHub using CTRL-P, Git: Commit and Sync.
